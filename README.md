Code Explanation/Breakdown

1. s, *d = str(number).partition("."): This line converts the given number to a string and then uses the partition method to split it into three parts: the part before the decimal point (s), the decimal point (if present), and the part after the decimal point (d).

2. [s[x-2:x] for x in range(-3, -len(s), -2)][::-1] + [s[-3:]]: This part of the code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the string s in reverse, taking slices of two characters at a time. It starts from the third character from the end (-3) and goes up to the length of s (excluding the decimal point) in steps of -2 (i.e., in reverse order). These slices represent groups of two digits in the number. The list comprehension then reverses the order of these groups ([::-1]) and adds the last three characters of s (representing the digits before the first comma, if any) as a single group at the end.

3. ",".join(...): This joins all the groups of digits with a comma between them.

4. "join([r] + d)": This joins the formatted integer part (r) with the decimal part (d), if any, and returns the final formatted string representing the number in Indian currency notation.
